/**
 *  Abstract interface for getting mapped command IDs. Command ID mapping
 *  means that xSP's own "Names List" command IDs ( constants that are usually 
 *  defined in a *.hrh file ) are substituted with IDs provided by Extension
 *  Manager. This is needed because there may be extensions using same 
 *  "Names List" command IDs. After the substitution, the original IDs are 
 *  not valid anymore. Still, in order to allow original "Names List"
 *  command IDs usage inside the xSP's own code, MxSPCommandMapper provides the
 *  mechanism for retrieving new IDs which correspond to the old original
 *  ones and vice versa.
